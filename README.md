### About the Experiment 

This experiment demonstrates how different windowing techniques—such as Rectangular, Hamming, and Hanning windows—affect the power spectrum of a signal. By applying these windows to signals and analyzing their frequency components, learners gain insights into spectral leakage and resolution in signal processing.
